# mc-texture-change

> ðŸŽ¨ Automatic Texture Changes script for Minecraft.

This script will automatically download the client.jar and find the changes in textures with the previous version of Minecraft when a new version is released.

## How it works

You go to the Minecraft Website and see that there is a new version was released. This means that in a few seconds all changes will be in the GitHub Repository.
If the new version of Minecraft contains any texture changes, a folder with the name of the version and subfolders (Added - new files, Changed - modified files, Deleted - deleted files) will appear. Otherwise, the folder will not be created.
