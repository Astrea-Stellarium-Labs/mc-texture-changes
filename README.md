# mc-texture-change

> ðŸŽ¨ Automatic Texture Changes script for Minecraft.

This script will automatically download the client.jar and find the changes in textures with the previous version of Minecraft when a new version is released.

This is a up-to-date fork of [Kraineff's](https://github.com/kraineff) now deleted version. Note that the commit history of the old version has been saved here - [this commit](https://github.com/AstreaTSS/mc-texture-changes/commit/ed483337426258d46a78df08c2810e316585040e) was the last commit they authorized.

## How it works

Every couple of hours, a script will be run comparing the latest Minecraft versions.
If there is a new version and it contains any texture changes, a folder with the name of the version and subfolders (Added - new files, Changed - modified files, Deleted - deleted files) will appear. Otherwise, the folder will not be created.
